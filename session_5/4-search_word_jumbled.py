"""This script counts how many times a word appears in a text.

NB: please run the download_text.py script first
to download the text we're going to count words in.


Exercises:
0. Run the script and look at the output. Does it run without an error?
1. The lines in the code are all jumbled up! Put them in the right order
   Hint: first put the comments in the right order, then insert the lines of code
2. Adapt the script to also count how many times the word 
   is mentioned in the text and run it again.
3. Highlight the search word in the line by surrounding it with two asterisks,
   like this: "In the **black** night, the stars shone brightly"
   (which string method are you going to have to use?)
3. Print not only the actual text of the line that contains the word,
   but also the line number
   (you will need a variable to keep track of the line number)

# PROCESSING
# load the text file into Python
filename = "frankenstein.txt"
    if word in line:

# tell Python which word you want to search for
    lines = file.readlines()
for line in lines:
# VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT
# loop through the lines and print the line if it contains the word
with open(filename, encoding="utf-8") as file:
        print(line)
# define which text you want to search in
word = "black"
